    h2 Coming soon
    p Athiest Children's Books is currently in development.
    h3 What's this all about?
    p Hi! My name's Ramon James - a book lover, writer illustrator, and asker of questions.
    p I've been carrying around the idea to create a site to promote atheist literature for children for a long time. Partly due to my own experience with religious education, and partly in response to the way modern religions indoctrinate the very young with stories of ghosts, hell and not very nice gods.
    p There are many intelligent, non-patronising (and awesome!) books out there that teach kids the virtues of curiousity, inquiry and science. They give kids the opportunity to think for themselves, rather than, like many of us had to do, 'grow out' of our beliefs.
    h3 So what's next?
    p I work on this site outside of my day job. If you'd like to contribute to getting this site up and running, or are an author of secular, humanist, science or atheist books for kids and would like to promote your book on atheistchildrensbooks.org, please get in touch.
    p Atheist Children's Books is currently (and constantly) development while we:
    ul
      li Finish the site
      li Create a database of books and approach authors for permission to promote their books
      li Make some fun stuff like games and puzzles! :)
      li ?
