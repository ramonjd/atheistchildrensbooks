          img.avery-sleep(src='/img/avery-sleep.png', alt='Avery Sleep looking through a telescope at you!')
          h2 Thanks for visiting Atheist Children's Books
          p This is Avery Sleep. He's like most kids you would say - he likes exploring, eating jam on toast with lots of butter, and romping around with his friends. Unlike most kids, Avery isn't from around here. Not from down the street, not from another city or country or even solar system, but from a little planet on the other side of the Milky Way called Libraria - home to the biggest collection of books anywhere in the universe. And do you know what Avery Sleep likes to do most of the time? That's right! Read books!
          p Because he's full of questions such as "I wonder if there are kids just like me on the other side of the galaxy?", he decided to jump into his ship, full it with books and visit us here on Earth to find out what books we love to read and ask more questions. Maybe you can help him find out a few things yourself!
          p
            strong Athiest Children's Books is currently in development.
          h3 Who's behind all this?
          p Hi! My name's Ramon James - a book lover, writer illustrator, and asker of questions.
          p I've been carrying around the idea to create a site to promote atheist literature for children for a long time. Partly due to my own experience with religious education, and partly in response to the way modern religions indoctrinate the very young with stories of ghosts, hell and not very nice gods.
          p There are many intelligent, non-patronising (and awesome!) books out there that teach kids the virtues of curiousity, inquiry and science. They give kids the opportunity to think for themselves, rather than, like many of us had to do, 'grow out' of our beliefs.
          h2 FAQS
          h3 Can I promote my book on atheistchildrensbooks.org?
          p Of course! Let us know about it via email and we’ll take a look. Please include:
          ul
            li a brief pitch/synopsis
            li target age range
            li cover photo
            li link to Goodreads/Amazon or other bookstore.

          p As well as illustrated books, we also love kids’ novels and poetry. We generally include books that:
          ul
            li help kids understand the values of secularism, humanism, science, art, literature, inquiry and/or a world free of religion
            li are well written and produced
          h3 Can you do a review of my book?
          p Yep. If you want us to write a review of your book, just send us a (preferably hardback) copy.
          h3 Does it cost anything to promote my book on atheistchildrensbooks.org?
          p No.
          h3 Are you sure? Does it really cost nothing to promote my book on atheistchildrensbooks.org?
          p Yep. We’re pretty sure. Okay, there are the normal costs, such as IT, electricity, coffee and everything else that keeps us happy.
          h3 So what's next?
          p I work on this site outside of my day job. If you'd like to contribute to getting this site up and running, or are an author of secular, humanist, science or atheist books for kids and would like to promote your book on atheistchildrensbooks.org, please get in touch.
          p Atheist Children's Books is currently (and constantly) development while we:
          ul
            li Finish the site (lot's of new, cool illustrations and the boring stuff like development)
            li Create a database of books and approach authors for permission to promote their books
            li Make some fun stuff like games and puzzles! :)
            li ?
